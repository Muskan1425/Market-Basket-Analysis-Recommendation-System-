# Market-Basket-Analysis-Recommendation-System-
This project applies market basket analysis to transactional data from Big Bakery in India to identify frequent item sets and association rules using the Apriori algorithm. The results help optimize product stock and inform reordering decisions to improve profitability and customer satisfaction.

Market Basket analysis is a technique applied by retailers to understand customer’s shopping behaviour  from  their stores.  The  result  of the  effective  analysis may  improve  supplier’s profitability, quality of service and customer satisfaction. Big Bakery is a company that operates as a Bakery in india.The purpose of this project is to make use of anonymized data on customers’ transactional orders to focus on descriptive analysis on the customer  purchase patterns,  items which are  bought together  and  units that  are highly purchased from the store to facilitate reordering and maintaining adequate product stock. It can be done by analysing the available data in such a way that a frequent item set can be found and can be analysed to define an association rule. One of the algorithms which helps in finding association rule for frequent item set and to identify the correlation is the Apriori algorithm. The model of the apriori algorithm is developed to explore approaches for the application of the rules of association to recommender system. Minimum confidence and minimum support values used for mining rules are parameters of the foremost existence.
